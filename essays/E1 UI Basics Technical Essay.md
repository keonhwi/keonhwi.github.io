For the first 3 WODs, I had no clue what I was doing the first thing that I did was to go over all the videos that were provided and I had to attempt with no timers first. Once I understand each command and code I was able to attempt each WOD. First WOD took me a whole day to figure out because in each section I wanted to master what each code does I was attempting with each code with different variables. When I tried to do with the timer I was way over the time limit so I had to go back and watch the videos again and practice some more. I think it took about 8 attempts to get Av and on the 7th attempt, I forgot to press record so I had to do it again. For the second and third ones, I jumped right into it but I had trouble connecting my CSS file to index.html so I reach out to my classmates and they help with it. Most of the work was very time-consuming and I realize it could be very simple but at the same time, this could be difficult to once you run into a problem.
