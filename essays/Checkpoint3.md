Here is my brief idea of the ppt f Assignment 3 
<img width="1003" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89577580/145285033-2e69dc64-3e6f-45d9-9894-d210a5da9d55.png">
Here is link for my screencast [Youtube](https://youtu.be/4eZI9U5Rqfw)
1. Describe your design for your siteâ€™s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.
 
 as of right now I am planning to have a separate page for the shopping cart which they can go and delete if they want and check what they have on their cart. 
 
2. Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.
  
  Just like assignments 1 and 2, it will store the data in the server and it could show once they go into the shopping cart and once they choose to check out. 
  
3. How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?
 
 I need to make sure that all the user is login to order or purchase the item from the store I have the same issue for assignment 2 where they do not log in or they do not register they will not be able to process to purchase.
 
4. Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)
 
 I kind of had some UI in assignment 2, once they log into their user id and get their information on the invoice I mention their name and at the final, I say thank you for your order and I will send an invoice to your email so I think that is good enough.
 
5. If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?
  
  I do not have partners but I would be happy to work with you as a group too.
  
6. How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2
  
  for assignment 3 I need to make sure all the codes are working and make sure I turn in everything in time. I know this one is challenging but with all the help that I could get from the professor and classmates, I will use it as much as I can.
