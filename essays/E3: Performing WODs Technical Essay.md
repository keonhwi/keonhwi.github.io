For Browser history 6 and Invoice 1, these works were much difficult and took a longer time than the first 3 WODs. To prepare for these WODs I tried to look through all the steps first and see if I was on the right track of doing it. Most of the time I had a difficult time with JS code and to find solutions I have looked upon the internet and solution parts. Many times there were parts that were slowing me down and end up with DNF I was getting frustrated. I've talked to many of my classmates for help and I shared what I know and they shared what they know. to be perfect on the invoice I watched the solution videos many times and practice sections multiple times so that I can finish in time. for the next WODs, I should just start working on it with the timer all the time because for me it took forever to try to understand.
