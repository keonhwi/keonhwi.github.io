My name is Keonhwi Rah but I usually go with Kenny. This is my first year at UHM, I transffered from KCC. I was planning on majoring something else in businnese field but I choose MIS because of how unique it is. When we approach to learn about something new in our life most of people do their research from their mobile devices. I was thinkng that I want some kind of major that make people covinence and hopefully, in the future I can use my major to help people and their work.
