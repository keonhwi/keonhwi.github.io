1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details

  Assignment 2 was designed to understand how to make a login page and registration page. Also, product information was required to stay together while they are logging in and registering. 

2. What did you learn from this assignment?

  From this assignment, I was able to figure out how to connect everything I have for it to take them to invoice. I was struggling with the registration page because I could not figure out how it is connected to the invoice. 

3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

  There was no partner for this assignment.

4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

  I need help I always contact my classmates first and we try to figure it out together by going over the code. Most of the time it works but if I can't find out I email the professor and he helps out through email and zoom.

5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

  This assignment was more technical than assignment 1 because if we messed up on the user info and the login page you will not be able to connect to the invoice so it is very important to make sure everything works.

6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
  
  For me, I'm more like do person which means I need to put everything in and see which code does what and I need to understand each part so most of the time I put the code and figure out what it does and use them by putting where it needs to be. testing for this assignment was kind of tough because if I make a simple mistake I need to go through the whole thing.

7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

  For this assignment, it was easier for me to approach since I learned many things from assignment 1, I was able to plan it better and prove where I wanted to better on assignment 1

8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

  If I could go back to where I could do things differently, I would say I should've bothered the professor more even though it could be a very simple and stupid question.
