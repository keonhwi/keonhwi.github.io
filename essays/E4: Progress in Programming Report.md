1.My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
    Honestly think that I am not that much better than how I was before because I am still learning. But I think that the way I understand code and the material is getting better.  The more I practice the more I get better at coding and understanding the steps. By doing assignment 1, I was able to understand the server side of codes and I was actually surprised that this simple code on the server can execute many functions. 
2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
    I need to have a better understanding of each command and actions of the code. I think this comes with more practiice and repetition. I have trouble with fixing my own codes however, fixing my own codes is a great way to practice because I can point out what I am ding wrong and find the solution. 
3. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
    I think that I always end up watchning the solution because theres a lot of things I think I am missing and when I see the solution, it helps me identiify what I need to work on. But I dont copy the screen cast but I use it as an example to understand my own work better.
4. The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
    Labs are easy becuase we go over it in class, so I dont have much trouble doing it. But if I run into trouble, I always go back to the class recording that I feel that I am lacking 
5. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
    I think that assignment 1 was difficult because I never had experience in coding. Even when I reached out to classmates for help, I still wasn't able to get a full understanding of the content. It wasn't until I met with profeesor about the work that I could fully understand the material. I don;t feel perpared for assignemtn 2 but I am willing to get help from classmates and professor if I need it. 
6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
    I think class is good. 
7. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
    SOmething that helps me the most is working with classmates and reaching out the proffessor. Reaching out to professor is the best option for me becuase I understand the content a lot more clearly.
