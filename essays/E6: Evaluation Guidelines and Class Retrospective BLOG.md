By the date and time indicated on the Schedule page (due no more than 1 day after submitting the assignment to your Assignment 3 on Laulima), write a technical essay (blog entry) that summarizes your experiences reflecting on your experience in preparing for, and implementing and what you learned from Assignment 3.

When providing answers to the following items, be as specific as possible. Avoid vague answers like “I learned a lot” and “My partner did all the work”. However, be as concise as possible. Copy this list of questions and put your responses below them:

1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
  
  My store is just a little surf store that sells surfboards, bodyboards, fins, and leashes which these products are essential if you want to surf.
  
2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
 
 I think I was able to solve everything with help from the professor I wanted this assignment to be perfect.
  
3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
  
  my shopping cart function where it shows and it brings back to product display and shows how many products are in the cart and it can adjust.
  
4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:
 
 I would like to say index because I've been seeing the same index for how and I am sick of it.
  
5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
 
 It was more time-consuming because this assignment had much more codes to put and delete. Even though there was some part where it made it easier but it took way too long.
  
6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
 
 I always go over the codes again first and double-check if I miss anything and this time I was able to use debugging.
  
7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
 
 I would like to say time management but at the same time I couldn't finish it on time but it took me a long time and ever since it was assigned I spent at least 30 minutes every day doing it.
  
8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
  
  Running into small issues because it was very difficult to figure it out since it had way too many codes. 
  
9. What did you learn from doing this assignment?
 
 I need to think before I put it into work such as planning and stuff. the plan helped me but I was also doing stuff without a plan and that's when I usually got into trouble. 
  
10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
  
  I would not add the other HTML first I would've kind of built it along with the server because on the server it is really easy to get lost. 
  
11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
  
  Thinking about code took me about 20% and 50% took me writing codes because it takes me a long time to understand and learn which one to use and the rest 30% was debugging and testing. 
  
12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
  
  I did not have any partners but I had big help from the professor. 
  
Use the same blog as you did in E1. When you complete your blog entry submit the link to Laulima as you did in E1.
